# This repo hosts a series of projects, experiments in various areas of generative ai


The projects range from being working prototypes of various POCs and also small practical use cases.
Currently you can find use cases like:

## Large Language models
1. [Light weight finetuning of Mistral models](https://github.com/silvererudite/generative-ai/tree/main/Light-weight-finetuning-of-llms)
2. [In context learning to personalize LLM responses](https://github.com/silvererudite/generative-ai/tree/main/Personalized_Real_Estate_Agent)
3. [Personal real estate agent](https://github.com/silvererudite/generative-ai/tree/main/Personalized_Real_Estate_Agent)

## Diffusion Models
1. [Interactive image editing app using inpainting](https://github.com/silvererudite/generative-ai/tree/main/Ai_photo_editing_with_inpainting)

## Vision Language Models
1. [Knowledge Graph-Augmented VLM for Factual Image Captioning](https://github.com/silvererudite/generative-ai/blob/main/vision_language_models/kg-augmented-vlm-for-factual-image-captioning.ipynb)
