# Project Overview
## Project Introduction

"Future Homes Realty" aims to redefine the real estate industry by offering uniquely tailored experiences to clients with its cutting-edge application, "HomeMatch". As a skilled developer at our company, you’ll be tasked with creating an app that transforms ordinary property listings into personalized stories, perfectly suited to each client's preferences and needs, ultimately boosting customer satisfaction and engagement.

### The Challenge

Our mission is to develop "HomeMatch", an app that harnesses the power of large language models (LLMs) and vector databases to craft personalized property listings for prospective buyers.

### Key Features of "HomeMatch"

1. **Understanding Buyer Preferences:**
   - Buyers will input their desires and needs, including location, property type, budget, amenities, and lifestyle choices.
   - LLMs will interpret these inputs, capturing nuanced requests beyond basic filters.

2. **Integration with a Vector Database:**
   - "HomeMatch" will connect to a vector database that stores all available property listings.
   - Vector embeddings will be used to match properties with buyer preferences, emphasizing details like neighborhood ambiance, architectural styles, and proximity to desired amenities.

3. **Generation of Personalized Listing Descriptions:**
   - For each matched property, an LLM will rewrite the description to highlight features most relevant to the buyer's preferences.
   - Personalization will focus on appealing characteristics without altering the factual details of the property.

4. **Presentation of Listings:**
   - The personalized listings will be presented as text descriptions tailored to the buyer’s preferences.
